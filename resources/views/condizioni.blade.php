        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Comments</h2>
        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, along with the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help with spam detection.</p>
        <p>An anonymized string (a hash of your email address) may be shared with Gravatar to check if you are using the service. See their privacy policy here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/" class="underline text-purple-300">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Media</h2>
        <p>If you upload images, avoid including embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors can download and extract that data from images.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Cookies</h2>
        <p>If you leave a comment, you may opt-in to saving your name, email and website in cookies for convenience. These last one year.</p>
        <p>A temporary cookie is set on the login page to check browser support for cookies. It’s discarded when the browser is closed.</p>
        <p>When logging in, cookies save login and screen display preferences. Login cookies last 2 days, display options 1 year. "Remember Me" extends login to 2 weeks. Logging out removes these cookies.</p>
        <p>When editing/publishing an article, an extra cookie stores the post ID. It expires in 1 day and contains no personal data.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Embedded content from other websites</h2>
        <p>Articles may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images). This behaves exactly as if you visited the other website directly.</p>
        <p>These sites may collect data about you, use cookies, track interaction, and monitor behavior, especially if you’re logged into that site.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Who we share your data with</h2>
        <p>If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">How long we retain your data</h2>
        <p>Comments and metadata are retained indefinitely to recognize and approve follow-ups automatically.</p>
        <p>For registered users, we store the personal data provided in their profile. Users can view, edit, or delete their data (except the username). Admins can also view/edit it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">What rights you have over your data</h2>
        <p>You can request an exported file of your personal data or ask us to erase it. This excludes data kept for legal, administrative, or security reasons.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400">Where your data is sent</h2>
